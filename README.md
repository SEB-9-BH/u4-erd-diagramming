# Entity-Relationship Diagramming

An ERD is a visual representation of the data structure in a database. It helps model how entities (objects) relate to each other. 

- Entities: Represent objects or concepts (e.g., "Book", "Author", "Publisher").
- Attributes: Characteristics of entities (e.g., "title", "ISBN" for a Book).
- Relationships: Connections between entities (e.g., "Author writes Book").
- Cardinality: Defines how many instances of one entity relate to another (e.g., one Author can write many Books, but a Book can have multiple Authors).


Schema design refers to the actual implementation of a database's structure, defining how data is stored, organized, and related. It includes:

Tables (or Collections in NoSQL): Represent entities.
Columns (or Fields): Represent attributes.
Primary Keys: Unique identifiers for records.
Foreign Keys: References between tables to maintain relationships.
Indexes: Optimizations for faster queries.

### Types of relationships and ERD Diagramming

#### One to One
A one-to-one relationship means that the each entitity only has one direct relationship to the other entity. An example of this in the real world would be the Earth only having ONE Moon, the solar system having only ONE Sun, or a country having one national flag. You can implicitly set the model relationships, meaning, you decide within your project if a user only gets one email to sign up with for that account.

#### One to Many
A one-to-many relationship means that one entity can be related to several of the other entities. A real world relationship would be a music venue having many concerts or a user having many posts. Once again, you can implicitly set what relationships you want. It depends on how you construct your database and the way those relationships are created.

#### One to Many to Many
A many-to-many relationship means that each entity can be related to multiple other entities of the other entity. That's a tongue twister! Consider a concept like a books can have many authors and many authors can create many books. OR movies can have many actors and many actors can belong to many movies.

## SETUP:

You will navigate to [Visual Paradigm](https://online.visual-paradigm.com/) to create a free account, and use the visual design tools to create a Schema using ERD diagramming. When you are done, take a **SCREEN SHOT** of the final schema design and place the screen shot in this lab folder: `03 Database-Modeling-Lab (D)`.

To create your **free** account =>
1. Navigate to [Visual Paradigm](https://online.visual-paradigm.com/)
2. Sign Up (you can use your google acct)
3. Once logged in, the main page will provide you with diagram templates that you can use. The `Class Diagram` template is great.

4. A new page will open on the class diagrams page.
5. **Select** a starting point from this page and choose to **edit that template**.
6. Work to figure out how to show the relationships amongst the entities provided in the chart below. 
7. **BE SURE TO CHANGE THE FIELDS TO REFLECT INFORMATION YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE FOR THESE ENTITIES**
8. Your final submission should be a screen shot that looks similar to this:
